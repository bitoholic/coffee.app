# Specification Quality Checklist: Coffee Brewing Settings Tracker MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Revalidated on 2026-07-05 after rewriting the Phase 1 Specification from the combined Telegram requirement set.
- The specification explicitly includes the full Brew Entry field set, predefined origins, custom origin reuse, validation rules, sorting, data safety, theme support, local persistence, out-of-scope items, automated test expectations, and README expectations.
- Mobile platform, navigation, local storage implementation, dependency choices, and exact run/test commands are intentionally deferred to planning, where the constitution requires them to be documented.
- Local-only persistence is included as a product constraint from the feature brief and constitution, not as a specific implementation technology.
